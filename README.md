# CS306 Project - Hospital Database Management System

This is the course project of the CS306-Database Systems course at SabancÄ± University, for the Fall 2023-2024 semester. 

In this project, by using MySQL, we aim to create an efficient hospital database for daily usage. 
A hospital or other medical facility's healthcare operations may be made more efficient and streamlined with the help of the Hospital Database Management System. 
This all-inclusive system facilitates the seamless operation of the hospital, improves patient care, and supports administrative duties by offering a central repository for storing, managing, and retrieving a broad 
variety of data. 

The team members are shown in the pdf file provided above.
